## Key Insights:
### Customer
United states has the highest customer-base with about 39,000 followed by Australia. It was noticed that Adult age group is the best performing age group in both gross sales and profit. However, the
Male customers made the highest of profit and average gross sales. From the matrix tables, we notices that the accessories product category was the most preferred product category and was also the most purchased by both gender followed by bikes.
### Recommendation:
I'll recommend that Marvis should channel her marketing prowess to clothing product category as it is the least preferred and purchased. The least country with customer base is France, hence Marvis
should make a business research and take survey in the country to determine which regions for a new outlet.

### Product:
Bikes was the product category with the highest profit and gross sales followed by accessories, although accessories was the most preferred. United stated made the most gross sales at $30.6M followed by Australia.
Canada was the least. Mountain black, 38 product topped the list of top-5 profit actualized by the products From the line chart, we can notice that the trend of gross sales and profit is an exponential one, having to saw
them rise from the year 2011 to 2016. Though 2015 saw the highest of gross sales and highest of profit was in 2014.
### Recommendation:
I'll recommend that more marketing prowess should also be put into clothing still. While Canada performed well in customer-base, it did not in the product analysis. Mountain black have proven to be the interesting product
that made the top of the chart. Over the years, the company have made a good feat in gross sales and profit. However, there was a drop in both in 2016 suggestion that there was a loop in the sales, thus, their should be a
meeting with the team to work out a possible solution for a drive.
